    <p>
      Created in 1981, the Coalition embraces a collaborative approach to unify
      people and mobilize resources to support its mission. The Coalition has
      been committed to tackling difficult problems that impact families and
      individuals who are experiencing homelessness or at-risk of losing their
      homes. It works to maintain awareness of the accelerating challenges of
      poverty and homelessness. Seen as a leader and expert in its field, the
      agency is called upon by peer organizations and state agencies to share
      its knowledge and expertise. Since its origin, the Coalition has been
      committed to developing programs that meet an unmet need, which in turn
      leads to long-term solutions to poverty and homelessness.
